Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34]
Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language, currently supported are only versions in the 3.x series. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Recent versions, such as Python 3.12, have added capabilities and keywords for typing (and more; e.g. increasing speed); helping with (optional) static typing.[35]
Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and it has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[36][37][38][39] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[40]
